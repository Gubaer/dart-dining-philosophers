# Dining philosophers

This repository provides three solutions for the [dining philosopher problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).

The solutions are implemented in [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) using Dart's
_isolates_ for concurrent programming.

Note that these solutions are ad-hoc implementations. The main goal was to
play around with Dart's concurrency primitives and not to implement one
of the known standard solutions.
